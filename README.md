## Dashboard Features  
- **Churn Per Payment Method**: Displays the number of churned customers based on their payment method (Bank Transfer, Credit Card, Electronic Check, Mailed Check).  
- **Total vs. Monthly Charges Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between total charges, monthly charges, and churn likelihood.  
- **Contract Type Churn**: Compares churn rates among different contract types (Month-to-Month, One-Year, Two-Year).  
- **Tenure Churn Count**: Visualizes churn distribution across customer tenure groups.  

## Key Insights  
- **High Monthly Charges Increase Churn**: Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn, especially in the early stages of tenure.  
- **Longer Tenure Reduces Churn**: Customers who stay with the company longer are less likely to leave.  
- **Contract Type Matters**: Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, while annual and biennial contracts improve retention.  

## Recommendations  
- **Introduce Lower Initial Pricing**: Attract new customers with lower initial rates and gradually increase charges for better retention and ROI.  
- **Encourage Long-Term Contracts**: Promote one-year and two-year contracts to reduce churn.  
- **Improve Customer Experience for High-Paying Users**: Implement loyalty programs and personalized offers for customers with high monthly charges.
